# translation-assignment
A university course assignment based on a 'bad translation' starter program from the textbook, with significant improvements to make it more versatile and sophisticated.
The program translates word-for-word from one language to another, disregarding grammar and limited by the number of languages and words programmed in. Improvements from the starter program are documented at the end of the program file.
